    <h2><b>The rules...</b></h2>
        <ul>
<h3>Picking Teams</h3>
<li><b>Pick 3 fighters</b> from each weight class (excluding Women's Featherweight as there are no current rankings)</li>
<li>Take it in turns to pick one fighter at a time</li>
<li><b>Picking order</b> will be determined by the finishing order of the previous season, so the player in last place from the previous season will pick first at HW, followed by third place, sceond place and first place until each player has picked three fighters. The order then rotates with each weightclass, so whoever picks first at HW will pick last for LHW, and whoever picked second at HW will pick first at LHW - and so on.</li>
<li>At least 1 of those fighters in each weight class <b>must</b> be unranked</li>
<li>Each fighter can <b>only</b> be on one team</li>
<li>A ranked fighter or champion can only be picked in the weightclass where they are ranked or champion (unranked fighters can be picked at the last weightclass they fought at, or a different weightclass they are scheduled to fight at)</li>
</ul>

            <ul>
                <h3>Scoring</h3>
<li>Scoring duration to last 12 months (January to December)</li>
<li><b>5 points</b> for a finish victory</li>
<li><b>3 points</b> for a decision/disqualification victory</li>
<li><b>1 point</b> for a draw</li>
<li><b>0 points</b> for a loss or 'no contest'</li>
<li><b>Negative 1 point</b> if your fighter misses weight</li>
<li><b>BONUS  3 points</b> if your fighter becomes champion (unless they were already interim champion, in which case only 2 bonus points will be awarded)</li>
<li><b>BONUS 2 points</b> if your fighter becomes interim champion</li>
<li><b>BONUS  1 point</b> for successfully defending a belt</li>
<li><b>BONUS 1 point</b> for winning a non-title fight main event</li>
<li><b>BONUS  1 point</b> for earning a performance bonus (fight of the night, performance of the night etc)</li>
<li><b>BONUS  ¬Ω point</b> for every rank difference (if your fighter wins). E.g. If your rank 14 beats rank 10 = 2 bonus points (all unranked fighters count as rank 16)</li>
<li>In the case of a <b>draw</b>, ranking bonuses will be awarded to the lower ranked fighter like they would with a win.</li>
<li>When ranked fighters compete in another weightclass, they carry their ranking -1 (so potentially earn an additional half a point in comparison to competing in the weightclass they are ranked in)</li>
<li>If your fighter changes weightclass after selection, points are awarded as normal</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h3>Transfers</h3>
<li>Transfer windows will occur at 4-month intervals (between the last event in April and the first in May, and the last event in August and first in September)</li>
<li>During transfer windows, each player can transfer up to three of their fighters for another fighter in that weightclass</li>
<li>Picking order will be determined by the current scoreboard at the time the transfer window opens - last place will pick first and first place will pick last</li>
<li>Each player <b>must</b> maintain one unranked fighter per weightclass (at the time of being picked)</li>
<li>Players may transfer in a fighter who has been transferred out by another player</li>
<li><b>Enforced transfers</b> - If a fighter is deemed to have permanently moved to a new weightclass (has fought more than once in a different weight class that they we're picked in, or only once but with another fight booked in the new weight class) then a player effectively has 4 fighter in the new weight class and only two in the old one, so MUST use the transfer window to transfer a fighter out from the new weightclass and in to the old one - Note: the fighter who has changed weightclass is not necessarily the one who need to be transferred</li>
<li>If a player has more than three of the aforementioned enforced transfers, other players will be granted additional transfers up to the same number - so all players can make the same number of transfers</li>
